'''
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): 

Employee class represents a single responsibility, 
defining basic attributes and an abstract method for role description.
'''
class Employee(ABC):
    def __init__(self, name):-
        self.name = name

    @abstractmethod
    def role_description(self):
        pass


'''
Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

Manager and Developer classes are open for extension (can add new roles) 
but closed for modification 

NB: don't need to change existing code for new roles
'''
class Manager(Employee):
    def role_description(self):
        return "Manager"

'''
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

ReportGenerator class has a single responsibility of generating reports,
and it works with any Employee type, adhering to LSP.

class ReportGenerator:

        print(f"{employee.role_description()} Report: {employee.name}")


'''
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

BonusCalculator class depends on abstractions (Employee), 
not on concrete implementations, achieving loose coupling.
